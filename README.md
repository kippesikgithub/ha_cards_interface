# Home Assistant Cards
Welcome to my github and some explanations about the interface and cards I build in Home Assistant. For every card i'll explain a bit about the contents and what features are in it. The room cards I use, are custom, but i re-use them throughout the whole interface, you can just place them in Grids or other cards to arrange them. The base for every room is the same card. Just use them in grids, horizontal/vertical stacks, stack-in cards, whatever floats your boat.  
The interface you see in the overview is our mobile dashboard, which is also usable for desktop. Every room has a Subview in where you can see all the detailed information or extended features for the entities in that room. I use the subviews, because they also contain a 'back' button by default.  
Down here you can see the overview and screenshots of the card, also mentioned which yaml configuration corresponds to that card in this repository.  
I will also include a short Guide later, on howto setup your first room card from the basic.  

First of all make sure you download the mushroom cards and mushroom themes in hacs. Apply the 'mushroom shadow' theme to the dashboard you copy my cards/code to. This is just my basic theme for a really long time, and I did all styling from that theme.  
Next download from hacs the: vertical-stack-in, stack-in, sankey diagram, apexcharts cards.
